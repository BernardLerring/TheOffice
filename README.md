## User Experience

### User Stories

### First time user goals

- First time users should be able to easily navigate the site and view the content on any device.

- First time users should be able to easily start the quiz.

### Returning user goals:

- As a returning visitor I want to be able to find updated questions on a regular basis.

- I would want to be able to submit questions of my own to make the quiz interactive and like a community. 

### Frequent user goals:

- I want to see a variety of different difficulty levels so I can continue to challenge myself.

## Design

### Colour scheme:

The main colours used are white, off white and black, to match the colour scheme of the original show credits. The red and green used for incorrect and correct answers are industry standard for such a purpose.

### Fonts/Typography:

The main font in use is Helvetica Bold as it is the font used in the original show title. The second font is Arial as Helvetica is not recognised on some browsers and Arial is the equivalent. The fall back font is Sans Serif should it not load. 

### Images:

The image is a screen grab from the episode of the show in which they partake in quiz night. This image was taken from https://www.joe.ie/quiz/ultimate-uk-office-quiz-season-1-695985

## Unfixed Bugs

### Personal Development

- I have struggled to get my head around Javascript, so the site is quite simplistic. With the tight timeframe to get this project submitted I played it safe, but would like to revisit Javascript at another time to try and fully understand the syntax, layout and functions used.
